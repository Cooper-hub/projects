## What is Robot Combat?

Robot combat is an engineering design challenge in which teams are set on creating the most
destructive robot with the goal of incapacitating their opponent. Starting in the 1990's, these
remote controlled vehicles have gathered the attention of the world throughout numerous
television shows and design competitions. Nowadays with the availability of cheaper
electronics it is an approachable hobby for all ages to tune their critical thinking and learn
STEM in a hands-on approach. Depending on the weight class, people interested in this
exciting hobby can participate with an investment of under $200. Robot fights can be an
extremely useful tool for developing a strong engineering mindset, especially as it relates to
physics. Similar to most engineering design challenges, (i.e., popsicle stick bridges), robot
combat is built off its constraints. In robot combat, the main constraints are cost, weight, and
time. Dealing with constraints and designing around them is a skill that is best developed
through practice and competition. 


## The Robot

Meet Cutting-Bored a wedge lifter bot with a frame made out of a cutting board. The robot was extremly budget constrained and used almost only recycled parts. 
The drive system is modified from a Roomba with a custom 3d printed gear housing and longboard wheels for extra traction. Out front it has a spatula to get under the 
competitor and win on the low ground. Its lifting mechanism is comprised of a single hobby servo scavanged from an old rc car.
