## Bionic Pec Project


Almost immediately after purchasing a 3d printer I fell down the rabbit hole of 3d printed prosthetics both for people and pets. I wanted to get involved. Unfortunately I do not know anyone personally who is missing a limb, but I do have a physical abnormality called Poland syndrome. This affects everyone differently but for me it means that I was born without my right pectoralis major muscle. Though this does not effect my physical abilities it is apparent when my shirt is removed and the difference has become more easily spotted as I work out consistently.

When photographed it appears more exaggerated than in person. 


As you can tell the difference between sides is fairly obvious in these photos, which has really impacted my shirtless modeling career. I have never been that self conscious about my lopsided nature, but I have experienced bullying which has just toughened my skin. On a day to day basis I really never notice the difference unless performing bench press or if someone asks me about it. 

The idea to create a prosthetic for myself came to me after watching a video about pickpockets and different types of hidden wallets. This is when I thought, hmmm, I have an empty space where my pec should be, I bet I could fit a wallet in there. This snowballed into me deciding to make a bionic pectoral prosthetic with a storage space, a Bluetooth speaker and maybe a flashlight where the nipple would be. After these grand ideas I went to my sketch pad and started drawing up potential ideas.
## Sketches

With these rough sketches I began trying to find a way to scan myself so that I would be able to work digitally and 3D model the prototype prosthetics. My first idea was to photogrammetry, a way to turn photo's into a three dimensional digital object, however after taking hundreds of photos I realized that it would not be accurate enough. After this I considered trying to make a 3D scanner using my Xbox 360 Kinect but again I was scared to risk breaking it. This lead me to eventually reaching out to a local company called scorpion technology who had a David 3D scanner which they allow individuals to use. Once I had cleaned up my scan using some mesh editing software I then had a virtual version of my chest rendered in the photo below.

## The Scan

## Version 1

This first version was very simple and essentially a test to see if my scan was properly scaled to be printed. From this first version I learned two important things: where I needed to remove material to keep my range of motion and that my pec has much less volume than previously thought. I did not bother to include straps to this version because it was far too inhibiting and uncomfortable to wear.

## Version 2

For this second version I used what I learned from my first attempt and ended up with a much more wearable device. With this version I now have full range of motion and it is comfortable to wear for many hours. It is fully 3d printed (except the straps) with a coat of paint on one side to give it a more interesting appearance.

## Future Work

Due to a heavy university course load this project has been sidelined however my work in this area is not yet done. I have purchased a Bluetooth speaker and am at this point preparing to do more cad work for my next version.
