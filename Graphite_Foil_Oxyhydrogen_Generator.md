## What and why?
Over the past two years my interest in hydrogen as an energy vector exploded after writing an English assignment about its potential uses in transportation. I wanted to be a part of this fairly ancient science of hydrogen so I decided to make an oxyhydrogen generator. Oxyhydrogen generators work by splitting the hydrogen and oxygen appart in a water solution using electricity. In the design of these apparatus there are two main design methodologies: wet generators and dry generators. I chose to create a dry generator because it lowers the danger of flashbacks. Dry oxyhydrogen generators work by containing a conductive water source in between plates to lower the voltage difference across each pair to around 2V and allowing for more surface area. Plate material choice is very important because it must be conductive and quite inert otherwise the material will dissolve and contaminate the gas and solution. The most often picked plate material by hobbyists is stainless steel because it resists wearing from the electrolyte and is conductive. Unfortunately, it is difficult to work and in electrolysis it forms chromium oxides which are extremely toxic. Another preferred material is graphite plates, I would have chosen these if they were not so expensive. In the end I chose the little brother of graphite plates known as graphite foil which carries similar properties to graphite but is significantly cheaper.       

## My design
In the end my design ended up sandwiching 6 graphite foil plates in between two acrylic squares. For electronics I used a modified 400 watt computer power supply using the 12 volt wires and a pwm motor controller to control the current output. The calculated maximum output of my design is 1 liter of oxyhydrogen per minute.

## Potential Uses
I wanted to use the generator for a small pulse jet that I designed parametrically so I could easily change it based on its performance. However, while testing the generator I accidentally detonated some of the gas and the noise damaged my hearing. It is now retired until further notice.
